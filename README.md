This is a pretty cool navigation extension for Chrome.

## Process

This process needs to be optimised quite a lot. That's why I'm writing it down!

### updating the layout
1. The navigation is drawn in Illustrator and saved as an SVG.
1. That SVG is then copied into popup.html
1. Most of the attributes are then replaced with class names (I haven't worked out how to work with classes in Illustrator)
1. CSS then controls presentation

### packaging and deploying
1. it's a mystery so far
